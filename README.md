# HR Analytics Dashboard
---
## Project Overview

### üéØ Objective
The primary goal of the HR Analytics Dashboard is to provide data-driven insights that help enhance employee performance, increase retention, and reduce attrition within an organization.

### üìù Steps Followed
1. **Data Extraction**: Extracted the client-provided data for analysis.
2. **Data Transformation**: Utilized Power Query in Power BI to clean the data by removing null values and duplicates, correcting spelling errors, and adjusting data types.
3. **Data Loading**: Loaded the cleaned data into Power BI's data model for further analysis.
4. **Data Modelling**: Established relationships between data tables and created a logical data structure to enable efficient analysis and visualization.
5. **DAX Implementation**: Used Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated measures and columns for advanced data analysis.
6. **Reports**: Developed user-friendly reports and interactive visualizations to present key insights effectively.

### üîë Key Insights
- The attrition rate in the Life Sciences Education sector is 38% (89 out of 237 employees).
- The highest attrition occurs among employees aged 26-35.
- Attrition spikes after employees complete one year with the company.
- Employees with salaries up to 5K experience the highest attrition rates.
- There is a direct correlation between job satisfaction and attrition rates, with lower satisfaction leading to higher attrition.
- Laboratory technicians have the highest attrition rate, with 62 employees leaving.
- Male employees experience a higher attrition rate compared to female employees.

These insights enable HR managers to take proactive steps to retain top talent, manage attrition, and foster a more productive work environment.
